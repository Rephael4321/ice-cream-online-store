# API Authorization Audit

**Summary:** Who can do what on every API endpoint.  
**Auth model:** HTTP-only cookie **`token`** holding a JWT backed by a row in **`sessions`** (`verifyPrivilegedSession` in `src/lib/jwt.ts`); roles: `admin`, `superuser` (admin-equivalent), `driver`.  
**Rules (from `protectAPI`):** GET is **public**; non-GET requires valid JWT and role in allowed set (default **admin-equivalent** (`admin`, `superuser`); some routes also allow **driver** or use **skipAuth** / **no middleware**).

**Conventions:** Client-side calls should use `src/lib/api/client.ts` (`api`, `apiGet`, `apiPost`, etc.). See `docs/conventions/API-USAGE.md`. Category APIs are **name-based only**; id-based category routes were removed.

## Auth primitives

| Mechanism | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|
| **withMiddleware** (default) | GET: anyone. POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE: **admin-equivalent** only (valid JWT with role `admin` or `superuser`, or legacy `id === "admin"`). |
| **withMiddleware(..., { allowed: ["driver"] })** | Same as above, but **admin-equivalent** (`admin`, `superuser`) and **driver** can call non-GET. |
| **withMiddleware(..., { skipAuth: true })** | No JWT check: **anyone** can call (including non-GET). |
| **withMiddleware(..., { middleware: validateClientOrderAccess })** | After normal auth: **admin-equivalent** → redirect to CMS; **client** → must have cookie `phoneNumber` and order must belong to that phone. |
| **No withMiddleware** | No server-side auth: **anyone** can call. |

---

## 1. Auth

| Method | Endpoint | Who can call | What they can do | Used |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|------|
| POST | `/api/auth/verify` | **Anyone** | Verify privileged session: JSON body may include `token`; if omitted, uses `token` cookie. Returns `valid: true`, `user` (`id`, `role`), `session` (`id`, `expiresAt`), or 400/401. | Yes |
| GET | `/api/auth/session` | **Anyone** | Returns `{ authenticated: false }` or `authenticated: true` with `user`, `session`. Clears invalid cookie. | Yes (JwtGatekeeper) |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | **Anyone** | Revokes current session (and optional `?all=1` for all sessions for user when token valid). Always clears `token` cookie. No JWT required to call. | Yes (CMS logout) |

---

## 2. Places (address search, key server-only)

The Google API key is never sent to the client. These routes proxy Google Places on the server.

| Method | Endpoint | Who can call | What they can do | Used |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|------|
| GET | `/api/places/autocomplete` | **Anyone** (GET) | Place suggestions for address search. Server calls Google with key from env. | Yes (AddressSearch) |
| GET | `/api/places/details` | **Anyone** (GET) | Formatted address and lat/lng for a `place_id`. Server calls Google with key from env. | Yes (AddressSearch) |

---

## 3. Image proxy

| Method | Endpoint | Who can call | What they can do | Used |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|------|
| GET | `/api/img-proxy?url=...` | **Anyone** | Proxy image from URL. Allowed hosts from `ALLOWED_IMAGE_HOSTS` only (SSRF guard). No JWT. | Yes (global-image-retry, image-picker-panel, unused-images, images upload) |

---

## 10. Images

| Method | Endpoint | Who can call | What they can do | Used |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|------|
| GET | `/api/images` | **Anyone** (GET) | List S3 objects under `images/` with display names from the index. Each item includes `url`, `key`, `name`, and **`inUse`** (whether the key is referenced in the DB; see below). | Yes (image view / `ViewImages`) |
| POST | `/api/images/upload` | **Admin**, **Superuser** | Upload image. | Yes (image-picker-panel, upload, upload-folder) |
| POST | `/api/images/rename` | **Admin**, **Superuser** | Rename image. | Yes (image-tile) |
| DELETE | `/api/images/delete` | **Admin**, **Superuser** | Delete S3 object and strip matching entries from `images-index.json`. JSON body: **`imageUrl`** (full URL) or **`key`** (e.g. `images/...`). Returns **409** if the key is still referenced by a product, category, or sale group. | Yes (image-tile, image view bulk delete, product `ImageCard` on `/products/images`) |

**Catalog usage for delete and `inUse`:** Implemented in [`src/lib/aws/image-usage.ts`](../src/lib/aws/image-usage.ts) (`listUsedImageKeys`): scans **`products.image`**, **`categories.image`**, and **`sale_groups.image`**. URL paths are normalized (including `decodeURIComponent` on URL pathnames) so keys align with S3 listing.

**CMS surfaces:** The menu link **ניהול תמונות** → **`/products/images`** lists **unused** images (`GET /api/products/unused-images`) with per-card delete (`ImageCard`). The separate full-library screen (`ViewImages` / `ImageTile`) uses **`GET /api/images`** and the same delete endpoint, with **`inUse`** disabling delete in the UI; the server always enforces usage on delete.

| **Client** | GET `/api/orders/client/[id]` only when cookie `phoneNumber` matches the order’s client phone. |
| **Driver** | Same as admin-equivalent for: PATCH `/api/orders/[id]/status`, PATCH `/api/orders/[id]/delivery`, PATCH `/api/orders/[id]/payment`, PATCH `/api/clients/[id]/address`, POST `/api/clients/[id]/payments`, POST/DELETE `/api/push/subscribe`, POST `/api/push/test`. CMS UI: drivers may open `/cms` (menu) and `/notifications` only among non-order client paths. All other non-GET: admin-equivalent only unless listed here. |
| **Admin**, **Superuser** | All non-GET endpoints (except those with skipAuth). GETs are public; admin-equivalent also gets redirect from `/api/orders/client/[id]` to CMS order page. |

---

## Removed endpoints (refactor)

The following routes were removed and must not be referenced:

- **Categories (id-based):** `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/categories/[id]`, `GET /api/categories/[id]/products`, `PUT /api/categories/[id]/products/order`
- **Categories:** `PATCH /api/categories` (update by id in body; app uses `PUT /api/categories/name/[name]` only)
- **Images:** `GET /api/images/index`, `POST /api/images/update-index`
- **Products:** `GET /api/products/by-sale`
- **Sale groups:** `POST /api/sale-groups/[id]/items` (productId in body), `DELETE /api/sale-groups/[id]/items` (productId in query). App uses `POST/DELETE .../items/[productId]` only.
- **Storage:** `GET /api/storage/unplaced-products`

Use name-based category APIs and the remaining endpoints only. For sale-group items, use `GET .../items` to list and `POST/DELETE .../items/[productId]` to add/remove.

---

## Security notes

1. **`/api/categories` (POST, PATCH)** – Protected with `withMiddleware` (admin-only for POST and PATCH).
2. **`/api/orders/by-phone?phone=...`** – GET is public; anyone who knows a phone number can list that client’s orders. Consider requiring cookie/session or signed token.
3. **`/api/orders/[id]/notify`** – PATCH is unauthenticated; anyone can set `is_notified` for any order ID. Acceptable only if used by a trusted webhook; otherwise restrict (e.g. secret header or internal-only).
4. **`/api/auth/verify`** – Accepts token in JSON body or falls back to `token` cookie. Verifies **stateful** privileged session (DB), not JWT signature alone. Use HTTPS in production.
5. **Privileged JWT and cookie lifetime** – JWT `exp` drives DB `sessions.expires_at` and (via edge middleware) the **`token`** cookie `maxAge` on `?token=` bootstrap. Defaults and CLI flags for minted tokens: [`JWT-GENERATION.md`](./JWT-GENERATION.md).
6. **Web Push** – `GET /api/push/vapid-public-key` exposes only the **public** VAPID key (by design). Subscriptions are stored per **`users.id`** (privileged `users` row: admin, superuser, or driver), not tied to `sessions`. Stale endpoints are deleted when the push service returns **404/410**. Use **HTTPS** in production; prefer **`mailto:`** for `VAPID_SUBJECT` in dev (see [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](./ENVIRONMENT.md)).
