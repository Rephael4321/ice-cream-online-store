# Thin-page rule

When editing or adding app route pages under `src/app`:

- The page file should **only** import one (or a few) components from `@/components` and pass `params` / `searchParams` as props.
- **No** business logic, form state, or data fetching in the page file.
- **No** heavy JSX; keep the page to a single return of a component.

**Template:** See `src/app/(root)/(cms)/orders/[id]/address/page.tsx` and `docs/conventions/PAGE-CONVENTIONS.md`.
